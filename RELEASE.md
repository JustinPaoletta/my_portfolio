# Release Process

This repository uses a manual changelog + release branch workflow.

## Standards

- Use Semantic Versioning.
- Create Git tags as `vX.Y.Z`.
- Keep `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` aligned to the release version.
- Treat `CHANGELOG.md` as the source of truth for GitHub Release notes.
- Cut release branches as `release/vX.Y.Z` from the protected default branch.

## Pre-Release Checks

Run these before opening a release PR:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

Also run these when the release changes visual behavior or performance-sensitive paths:

```bash
npm run test:visual
npm run lighthouse
```

## Release Checklist

1. Update your local copy of the protected default branch.
2. Review `CHANGELOG.md` and confirm `## [Unreleased]` accurately describes the release scope.
3. Choose the next version using SemVer.
4. Create the release branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull --ff-only
   git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
   ```

5. Bump the app version without creating a tag yet:

   ```bash
   npm version --no-git-tag-version X.Y.Z
   ```

6. Move the release notes from `## [Unreleased]` into a dated section like `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, then leave a fresh empty `Unreleased` section at the top.
7. Run the pre-release checks.
8. Commit the release branch changes:

   ```bash
   git add package.json package-lock.json CHANGELOG.md README.md RELEASE.md
   git commit -m "chore(release): prepare vX.Y.Z"
   ```

9. Open a pull request from `release/vX.Y.Z` into the protected default branch and merge it after review.
10. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

11. Publish the GitHub Release from the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for `X.Y.Z`.
12. Continue adding new work under `## [Unreleased]` for the next cycle.

## Hotfixes

1. Branch from the latest release tag as `hotfix/vX.Y.Z`.
2. Apply only the production fix and the matching changelog update.
3. Run the relevant checks for the changed area.
4. Merge the hotfix branch into the protected default branch.
5. Tag and publish the hotfix as `vX.Y.Z`.

## Notes

- This repo no longer relies on Changesets or bot-created release PRs.
